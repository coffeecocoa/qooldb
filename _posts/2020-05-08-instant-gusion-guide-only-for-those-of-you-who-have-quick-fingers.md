[Gusion](https://mobile-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Gusion) is a mage assassin who specializes in charge and burst. Just like Karina, the damage produced by Gusion is magic. Assassins of this type of magic are usually able to kill tank heroes quickly enough because they have <b style="color: red;">low magic defenses</b>. But in fact many Gusion users are not even able to kill heroes like archers themselves.

The main cause is of course the way to use skills and combos from Gusion which is still not fully understood by most of the users. Well, some time ago one of the pro Mobile Legends players from the EVOS Team, <b style="color: red;">JessNoLimit</b>, gave guidance on how to use Gusion correctly and maximize its potential as an assassin. Here are the points!

*   The main source of Gusion's damage is its <b style="color: red;">Second skill, Shadowblade Slaughter</b>. This skill makes Gusion throw 5 swords at the target, which can be summoned again by pressing the two skills again.
*   Damage from <b style="color: red;">Shadowblade Slaughter</b> will be very large to one target if executed from very close range (the five swords will hit the target).
*   Gusion has several skill combination options that you can use according to the situation and conditions. Next we will call <b style="color: red;">Sword Spike = skill 1</b>, <b style="color: red;">Shadowblade Slaughter = skill 2</b>, <b style="color: red;">Incandescence = skill 3</b>, <b style="color: red;">normal attack = normal hit</b>.
*   The first combo is a normal combo in the order of <b style="color: red;">1-1-2-normal hit-2</b>. This combo can immediately kill enemies who are in a wounded condition. Then you can use <b style="color: red;">skill 3</b> to escape from battle.
*   The second combo is a maximum combo in the order of <b style="color: red;">1-1-2-normal hit-2-3-2-normal hit-1-1-2-normal hit</b>. The damage caused by this combo is very large and can kill tank or warrior heroes. Use <b style="color: red;">skill 3</b> again to leave the battle.
*   The third combo is an instant kill combo in the order of <b style="color: red;">2-3-2-1-1-2</b>. When you use this combo, Gusion will issue 10 swords that can instantly finish off the target very quickly. Very effective at killing hero mages and archers.

That was [Gusion](https://mobile-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Gusion)'s brief guide with the combination of skills he had. Surely it takes time to execute the combos above until they are truly proficient.
